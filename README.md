Final Year Assignment – Enterprise Application Development (SE4040)

## 📖 Overview
VoltReserve is an **EV Charging Station Booking System** with:

- **Web Application (Backoffice + Station Operators)**
- **Mobile Application (EV Owners & Operators – Android with SQLite)**
- **Backend Service (C# .NET Web API + MongoDB Atlas, hosted on IIS)**

The system enables:
- Management of **web users** with roles **Backoffice** and **StationOperator**
- CRUD operations for **EV Owners** (NIC as primary key)
- **Station Management** (create, update, schedules, deactivate if no active bookings)
- **Booking Management** (create/update/cancel with time rules, QR validation, session finalize)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API (C# 9.0+)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL)
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer Tokens
- **Authorization:** Role-based (`Backoffice`, `StationOperator`)
- **Frontend (Web):** React + TailwindCSS/Bootstrap 5
- **Mobile:** Native Android (Java/Kotlin + SQLite)

### High-Level Flow
1. EV Owners create accounts (NIC = PK).
2. Owners make bookings (≤ 7 days ahead, changes/cancellations ≥ 12h before).
3. Backoffice manages users, stations, and schedules.
4. Station Operators monitor bookings and handle onsite QR code validation.
5. JWT-based role enforcement ensures security.
